# health-report-pdf-login-form-php
The register.php file is the registration form that gets user information and stores it in the MySQL database; it also stores the name of a pdf. The actual pdfs are stored in a repository called "pdfs".

The get_health_report.pdf feature later allows retrieval of the PDF when the email ID of the user is given.
